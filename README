Welcome to dwerg version 0.8

This theme-engine was based on a skin made my Everaldo <everaldo@everaldo.com> for trillian, The first version was based on cleanice, currently it doesn't share any code with other engines. Thanks to Everaldo, the authors of Cleanice and Giel de Nijs for betatesting.

To install just fo the following (well known) magic:

./configure [--prefix=/where/you/installed/gtk2]
make
make install

Then either use the Gnome Control Center to select the theme or put the
following into your ~/.gtkrc-2.0 :

gtk-theme-name = "dwerg"

Have fun!
